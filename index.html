            In this game, a player holds a number of marbles in their hand. The other
            player must guess if the number is odd or even. If the player guessing
            is correct, he gets the same number of marbles as he’s holding 
            (his wager). If he doesn’t guess correctly, he forfeits the same 
            number of marbles as the other player is holding.
